## BUBBLE SORT

- Compares pairngs of adjacent elements
- Two loops
  - First loop iterates as long as list is unsorted
  - second loop is for comparison of the elements.
- Bubble sort requires multiple passes
- Inner loop takes (N-1) iterations and outer loop takes N iterations where N is the number of elements in the list.
- Big O runtime *O(n(n-1)) = O(n(n)) = O(n^2)*

## MERGE SORT

- *Divide and Conquer Algorithm*
- Major two steps:
  - divide the data in smaaler components(*or runs*)
  - then combine the data into a sorted list(*or merge*)
- We divide the list into halves and then sort each of them
- After both of them are sorted, the halves are compared to each other until a sorted list comes as an output
- In merge sort the best, worst, and average time complexity are all same i.e *O(N*Log(N))*
