## BUBBLE SORT

- Compares pairngs of adjacent elements
- Two loops
  - First loop iterates as long as list is unsorted
  - second loop is for comparison of the elements.
- Bubble sort requires multiple passes
- Inner loop takes (N-1) iterations and outer loop takes N iterations where N is the number of elements in the list.
- Big O runtime *O(n(n-1)) = O(n(n)) = O(n^2)*
